# HackNC24
I am currently a first semester freshman at ECU and I followed online tutorials to make this project. 

This game features bow combat vs hordes of enemies. Every time you die or choose to restart (By pressing 'R') the enemies will spawn in random locations. It is a fun little dungeon crawler that lets you go around and kill fun little enemies.

The controls are simple:
  Arrow Keys to navigate the menu
  Point and click left on your mouse where you want to shoot arrows
  Right click to throw bombs
  Space key to dash
  
  Enjoy!
