# HackNC24
I am currently a first semester freshman at ECU and I followed online tutorials to make this project. 

This game features bow combat vs hordes of enemies. Every time you die or choose to restart (By pressing 'R') the enemies will spawn in random locations. It is a fun little dungeon crawler that lets you go around and kill fun little enemies.

The controls are simple:
  Arrow Keys to navigate the menu (return key to choose an option), 
  WASD to move, 
  point and click left on your mouse where you want to shoot arrows, 
  right click to throw bombs, 
  space key to dash

  The game file is in the folder titled, 'HACKNC_Game_Folder'
  
  Enjoy!

  Assets pulled from the youtube channel, Slyddar. He provides free assets and sound effects for use in the project.
