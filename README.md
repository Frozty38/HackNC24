I am currently a first semester freshman at ECU and I followed online tutorials to make this project. 

This game features bow combat vs hordes of enemies. Every time you die or choose to restart (By pressing 'R') the enemies will spawn in random locations. It is just a fun little sandbox to kill fun little enemies. Enjoy!
